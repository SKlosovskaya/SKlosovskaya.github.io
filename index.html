    <h2>About Albatross</h2>
    <p>Albatross is a type of sea bird. There are 21 species of albatross that live mainly in the south hemisphere. They inhabit Antarctica, Australia, South Africa and South America. Rare species of albatross live in the northern hemisphere and inhabit Alaska, Hawaii and California. Albatross spends almost entire life on the ocean. It can be seen on the land only during the mating season. 19 out of 21 albatross species are endangered because of the by-catch (birds end up trapped in the fishing nets), decrease of their natural prey, introduction of invasive species (which eat eggs and young birds) and massive hunting.
